## Training

- Install dependencies

  make sure your have node.js installed on your computer

  run `npm i` in your terminal to install dependencies

- Run Gulp
  When you want to start developing, run gulp to compile the files and watch your changes.
  run `gulp` in your terminal to run gulp default task, which will compile your resources, move them into a distribution folder, and serve them on localhost:3000

- Make sure you push all of your changes and updates to github.

Good luck :)
